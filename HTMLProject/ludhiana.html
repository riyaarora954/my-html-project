            <h1>History of Ludhiana</h1>
            <p>
              Ludhiana city was founded in the time of Lodhi dynasty which ruled
              in Delhi from 1451-1526 A.D. The legend goes that two Lodhi Chief
              Yusaf Khan and Nihand Khan were deputed by Sikandar Lodhi
              (1489-1517 A.D.) to restore order in this region. They camped at
              the site of present city of Ludhiana which was then a village
              called Mir Hota. Yusaf Khan went across the river Sutlej in
              Jalandhar Doab to check Khokhars who were plundering the Doab and
              made a settlement at Sultanpur while Nihand Khan stayed back and
              founded the present city at the site of village Mir Hota. The new
              town was originally known as Lodhi-ana, which means the town of
              Lodhiâ€™s. The name later changed to the present name
              Ludhiana.Ludhiana is now a District Headquarter with Parliamentary
              Constituency of the same name. It is one of the biggest Municipal
              Corporations of the State.
