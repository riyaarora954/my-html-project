            <h1>History of Jalandhar</h1>
            <p>
              The city may be named after Jalandhara, a Nath Guru who was from
              here. The city was founded by Devasya Verma as mentioned in the
              Vedas. Other possibilities include that it was the capital of the
              kingdom of Lava, son of Rama or that the name derives from the
              vernacular term Jalandhar, meaning area inside the water, i.e.,
              tract lying between the two rivers Satluj and Beas.[5] The whole
              of Punjab and the area of present Jalandhar District was part of
              the Indus Valley Civilization. Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are the
              sites where remains of the Indus Valley civilisation have been
              found extensively. The archaeological explorations made during
              recent years have pushed the ancient times of Jalandhar District
              of the Harappa period. Jalandhar was known as Prasthala during the
              Vedic period and it was the capital of the Trigarta Kingdom.
