            <h1>History of Punjab</h1>
            <p>
              The History of Punjab refers to the past history of Punjab region
              which is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in the
              northwest of South Asia, comprising eastern Punjab province in
              Pakistan and western Punjab state in India.[1] It is believed that
              the earliest evidence of human habitation in Punjab traces to the
              Soan valley of the Pothohar, between the Indus and the Jhelum
              rivers, where Soanian culture developed between 774,000 BC and
              11,700 BC. This period goes back to the first interglacial period
              in the second Ice Age, from which remnants of stone and flint
              tools have been found.[2] The Punjab region was the site of one of
              the earliest cradle of civilizations, the Bronze Age Harrapan
              civilization that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and declined
              rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations
              that overran the region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C.[3] The
              migrating Indo-Aryan tribes gave rise to the Iron Age Vedic
              civilization, which lasted till 500 BC.
